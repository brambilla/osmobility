Discrete Event Simulator for Vehicular Mobility

OSMobility allows to simulate the motion of different entities (e.g. cars, pedestrians, bicycles, etc.) in realistic geographical spaces. It is integrated with OpenStreetMap, an open database which provides geographical data, such as road maps, for free. Thus, OSMobility allows to simulate vehicles running on highways or urban roads, pedestrians walking within limited traffic zones, bicycles moving on cycling lanes, etc.

The software-in-the-loop simulation methodology OSMobility adopts, allows to test deployment software on simulated devices, immersed in simulated environments.
